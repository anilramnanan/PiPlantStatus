# PiPlantStatus

## What is it ?

PiPlantStatus uses a Raspberry Pi to gather information from various sensors attached to a plant. These include a  Temperature and Humidity Sensor, Light Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor. 
This data is used to create a message and send it out as a tweet along with a picture of the plant taken with a webcam. The light sensor is used to determine if there is enough light to 
take a picture of the plant.
