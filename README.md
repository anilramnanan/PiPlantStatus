# PiPlantStatus

## What is it ?

PiPlantStatus uses a Raspberry Pi to gather information from various sensors attached to a plant such as Temperature and Humidity Sensor, Light Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor. This data is used to create a message 
to tweet to a Twitter account. The light sensor is used to determine if there is enough light to take a picture of the plant. The photo is taken by a webcam by a shell script.
